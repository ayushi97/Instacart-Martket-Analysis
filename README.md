# Instacart-Martket-Analysis

**Problem Analysis:** 
Grocery shopping is a personal experience. As a shopper peruses through a store, they often purchase additional items based on their personal preferences, sentiments regarding the product, and ingredients required in recipes. Instacart has revolutionized shopping; a once “therapeutic” experience can be done from the convenience of a phone, and order-to-delivery of groceries can be completed in under an hour. As Instacart has revolutionized the grocery industry, maintaining a personal connection with customers is essential to sustaining success. Similar companies will continue to emerge, and the grocery delivery industry will become even more competitive.

```Instacart must find a way to connect with their customers to develop brand loyalty, and establish a sustainable competitive advantage in the marketplace.```

We have found the dataset on kaggle. This dataset contains userid for maintaining the identity anonymous and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users.
